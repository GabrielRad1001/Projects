# Projects
My first projects made from online courses of Front End Path from Scrimba.

I wanted a reconvert to an IT domain so I started looking for some online courses on Google and I found Scrimba.
I learned basics from HTML and CSS and made two mini projects as excercices. I'm very eager to learn the Front End Path and probably If everything goes well I will try to find a job.
This year I participated in an academy at the OSF Digital Company where I received a certificate for Salesforce Marketing Cloud Administrator.
Now I'm focusing on learning Java Script.
